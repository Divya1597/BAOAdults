   "description": "Guadalupe Oak Grove Park is a 62 acre city of San Jose park and one of the last remaining large tracts of deciduous oak savanna and oak woodland in the Santa Clara Valley. You will see blue, coast live and valley oak trees along about two miles of mostly flat, dirt trails. There are a couple of small loops that take you uphill for views of the oak trees. This is a great place for birding because the oaks and nestboxes are home to cavity nesters like Chestnut-backed Chickadees, Oak Titmice, White-breasted Nuthatches, Bushtits, Lesser Goldfinches, Annas Hummingbirds and more. There are many Acorn Woodpecker granaries here as well. At the main park entrance, there are restrooms and picnic tables.",
